Welcome! I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Computer Science department at UC Berkeley, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Alvin Cheung](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~akcheung/) and [Sanjit Seshia](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/). I am interested in teaching machines to write programs (AKA Program Synthesis). In particular, my research focusses on building framework for translating code across programming languages ([verified lifting](https://metalift.pages.dev/)). 

Prior to joining grad school, I was a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) where I had the privelege of learning from [Nagarajan Natarajan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nagarajn/), [Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org/) and [Rahul Sharma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rahsha/).

My academic journey has also included valuable collaborations with [Rishabh Singh](https://rishabhmit.bitbucket.io/), during my undergrad and as a research intern in the summer of 2022 at [Google X](https://x.company/).
